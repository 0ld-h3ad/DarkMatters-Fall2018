**Course Description**

In this course we will consider together the surveillance of Blackness and the positioning of white as neutral within interfaces as perpetual forms of violence through high technology. We will discuss how we all can use computational systems to create change while holding them accountable to their origins and biases. For this course we will be reading Simone Browne and other critical theorists to understand how these structures are compromised so that we can begin to imagine what an outside to them might look like. We will also use the practices of artists critiquing (and expanding the imaginary within) technology as examples of how radical imagination can be evoked through artistic practice.

**Expectations**

  * The readings are mandatory. I am not asking you to read much so I ask that you read the texts completely and come prepared with questions.
  * Come prepared to speak as well as listen. We will learn the most if everyone contributes to class discussion.
  * Be aware of your position, if you are talking more than others step back and give others the opportunity to speak.
