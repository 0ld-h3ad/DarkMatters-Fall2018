First, honestly I noticed that I have almost no idea how to treat racial problems. One reason is that I am Japanese, neither white nor black. Even as a colored person, an education of Japan does'nt treat such  problems and they(we) rarely take themselves as a minoritiy - I suppose this is because Japan is originally a monoracial country.

However, I imagined from the reading, if Japan were multiracial country, what was the early computers in Japan like? The reason why I thought that because a path of the earliest computer in Japan was an interesting, it was a commercial and invented by almost 1 person.

FUJIC, the first computer in Japan is developed by Bunji Okazaki, an engineer of FUJIFILM. In fact, it was used for a calculation of a lens for a camera. The development was done only by Bunji and one women calculator because most of people in FUJIFILM is not interested in the computer, and they developed in weekend or after a regular worktime, as out of regular job. The project of TAC, the computer by University of Tokyo and several big companies had started in advance to FUJIC but they had a many troubles to determine specifications of machines, as a result, the project delayd and completed after FUJIC's completion: 1954, it was earlier even in a worldwide situation.

I saw the actual apparatus of FUJIC in Science Musium in Tokyo. What is interesting for me was the output section. A part that outputs a result of a calculation of FUJIC is a modified typewriter, wires are connected to each keys and pulled by solenoids or motors. The look is feeling like DIY stuff.

This history seems, for me, a rare case that the speed by small people exceeds that of the huge organization, in particular in a world of computer science.

I don't know much about how is the history of GUI in Japan and I think current social situcation in computer science in Japan is common to it in world, particlualy about gender inbalance.

I might need a bit more time to take these problems related to me, how should I manage the feeling of "whiteness" including out of computer science?
