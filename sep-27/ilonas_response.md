I liked that powerful visual metaphors were at the center of this piece. If anyone I knew had designed the GUI, we probably would not have used the office culture xerox PARC skewmorphs that our GUIs all consistent of now. Knowing the communities that I am most fond of, we would have used language and structures that more closely resembled living cooperatives and consensus building structures. That said, these metaphors are so ingrained in me that’s it’s difficult to even imagine a different set. I don’t even know that if my friends and I settled on a visual system for computing that we would have chosen having clickable icons at all, or even having a desktop.

Thinking through the question of how my friends and I might have created a GUI in the context of this article was a melancholic process. It made me think of how the dream of the internet was to have a decentralized free source of knowledge and how instead it consolidated into a few key players hosting all of the content but how we could have built it differently with equality in mind and centering on communities.

I don’t see the transition from the black screen to the white GUI as an *intentionally* “violent” act. I expect that the creators of the GUI were dreaming up the best most “friendly” interface they could imagine. The trouble is, that “they” were made out of a very specific demographic of predominately white men. Because of biases that they were born with, and the Xerox PARC environment that they were living in, they had their own assumptions of what the “most friendly” meant. Additionally I am thinking about *intent* vs. impact. I think the intention here was to innovate, but I’m still meditating on the impact.
