Black Gooey Universe // American Artist - response

Friends and family, as designers of computer technology:
  dad: My dad was a machinist by trade, also working in power plants.  He's always wanted to understand how something mechanically works brefore he'll use it (including air travel).  He'd design something physical, with precise machinery he would understand how to rebuild if needed.

  sister: My sister is a late bloomer in her 50s -- she would design something highly organized, oriented toward helping people, both the 'users' of the computer, as well as those she and those users would be helping.
  brother: My younger brother was an electrician by trade - he would be designing with electric circuitry, and those circuts would occassionaly short circuit.  The computer would also make jokes.
  friends: Several of my friends would design an interface with a pen or pencil, or would have an input interface using music.

Black screen/white screen -- coded violence -- this is a challenging question, so let me work through it here in writing.  I think of coding more as a kind of sorcery or magic, where it can be learned (high magic?), or divined (hacking, trying things out, experimental).  In that latter context, code and the command line are the interface, rather than the GUI.  Your role interacting with the computer is as someone constructing GUI. My other context is world of film -- black on the screen is undeveloped, primed, ready to create with film; it blocks the light of the projector on its own, yields color when developed, and creates experience when developed.  White on the screen is clear film leader -- the absence of anything on the film; it yields only bright, harsh light when in a dark room, and does nothing in and of itself.  This might be bending some of the metaphors for the GUI posited in American's writing, but is my mental model for understanding the writing.

This said -- I must say that I don't know how to determine when an innocuous act is coded violence rather than a coincidence, and look forward to discussing in class.

Family and technology:
This was an excellent question to ask -- I've been studying my family's origins across the US, since immigrating from Sweden, Germany, and England in the 1700s and 1800s, and I've studied where parts of my family were at in the US at particular points in time.
1918 - bridges, early cars, early telephone, farm markets (corn futures, etc), electricity, subway
1818 - ships, farm equipment, sewing machines, industrial printing press
The printing press realization took me on some searches for the first St Louis newspaper, which started in the early 1800s -- much of my family was in Missouri and Iowa in farm country.  There are some excerpts from the article that sum up some the ways my family may have been interacting with technology of the time.
Commentary on St Louis Gazette, 1808: 'There were notices about runaway slaves, but most of the chattel business concerned renting out slaves for hire. One ad sought a domestic “who understands the American mode of cooking.”'

Abstraction:
Creates separation from the problem at hand, creates a language and system which can manipulate underlying labor sources, typically provides for further abstractions to create even further separation and/or plausible deniability.  Lack of accountability, hide negative aspects / 'casualities' of exploitation.
