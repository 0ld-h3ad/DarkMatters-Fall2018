Black Gooey Universe

As a visual designer, you’re taught that white space is good. The more white space there is, 
the easier it is for people process content. Especially with the rise of “flat design,” white 
is being used everywhere (so many app icons have a white background.) White is considered 
neutral. I wonder if gooeys became white because of the history of graphic design. Newspapers 
were probably white with black text to save printer ink. Also why is white space even called 
white space? “White space” doesn’t even have to be white! It’s really just a blank space on 
the page. 

This essay also made me think about the rise of making programming more friendly and playful. 
The default background colors of the Mac terminal and xCode are both white. Scratch is filled 
with colorful tiles. There are so many products out there nowadays that try to get as far from 
the Black screen as possible.

Lastly, I’m very triggered by how these white cis men named the first gooey computer a 
historically female (and white) name. It’s so frustrating when you can see how one moment 
in history can affect SO many decisions in the future: Siri, Alexa, Cortana, etc. 
Almost EVERYONE interfaces with these on a day to day basis.
