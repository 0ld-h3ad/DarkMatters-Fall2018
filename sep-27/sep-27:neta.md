ok. hold up. pause. breathe. 

enter the "Black Gooey Universe" 

i'm here now. 

generally dishonored, natally alienated, socially dead—yet very much alive. 

i'm Black. 

the gooey is my livelihood, also my death. 

for others the metaphor of the gooey is immaterial or abstract, but i live in the black, i am the black, i am beyond. 

i embody the gooey, i challenge their understanding. 

i break into and out of their understanding of racial and computational structures. 

i'm surrounded by those who attempt to logic themselves out of the irrational. 

what would the afro-pessimist logic gate be? exclusive or?

moten's formula blackness 
	blackness >< 1

how disorienting. i might fall over.

but then i remember how my people tie babies on their backs with cloth and carry gallons on their heads.

falling over isn't a problem when you never had ground

ok. hold up. pause. breathe.

i fell.

straight into the ocean. 

stateless.

but i'm here now.

blackness registers as "nothing" to those who don't understand it

this nothingness has gooey texture
