## A response to *On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge*
###### *Susie Fu*

I was curious about when this was published (note: 2005). Initially, I thought, "the world of software is even more ridiculous now, a lot of this theory could be expanded." But one  convenience of comparing a current state to the previous state relatively is being able to compare a future state to the current state in the same way, like a mathematical ratio.

I was very drawn to the section about abstraction and users. Chun writes, "Direct engagement emphasizes emotional as well as cognitive values. It conceives of human-computer activity as a designed experience." In 2005, emotional and cognitive values translated from operating systems, computer games, and being able to find anything on the web. In 2018, designed experiences span living spaces (Alexa, etc), working spaces (consumerization of SaaS), and inner spaces (Headspace, Instagram addictions). Has anything drastically changed, or is the exponential growth of abstraction naturally falling in line with the exponential growth of software?

"Software, or perhaps more precisely operating systems, offer us an imaginary relationship to our hardware: they do not represent transistors but rather desktop and recycling bins," Chun poses. Perhaps in today's lingo, desktops and recycling bins are replaced by immersive, seamless extensions of human-ness through new, flashy interfaces. What do we lose as we move further and further away from transistors at (maybe) a steady change of change?

How do we as artists face and respond to society as a whole?
