# Response+Notes: On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge
### WENDY HUI KYONG CHUN

#### Is there a real distinction between software and hardware or is it just semantic?

I think hardware is software's potential. Or maybe hardware is software's possibility space.

A vague and unhelpful analogy I'm drawn to is comparing the **body to hardware**.
Hardware is to the body as software is to posture. The posture—arrangement of limbs—signifies an action. Posture is only a state of the body. Action is the referent of posture.

Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, however, mentions Friedrich Kittler who says "there is no software" since everything reduces to voltage difference as signifiers. To me that seems too reductive. Why not go one step further towards the arrangement of molecules or atoms as signifiers?

What does Wendy Hui Kyong Chun mean by the "waning" importance of indexicality?

#### Why and how has white male fragility been central to the development of technology?

White fragility, when a light is put on racial disparities and triggers a particular defensiveness, is an impetus for white supremacist mentalities. Technology is one method for preserving a structure of power. Technology as obfuscation. Technology as imprisonment. The whole idea of algorithmic _neutrality_ and _fairness_ through machine learning, that suffers the fundamental flaw of biased programmers, datasets, contexts, and histories.

The term slave persists. Master / Slave. Wendy Chun notes that Alan Turing called wrens slaves. In what way is all of technology not an artifact of the need to dominate and control. And is it a coincidence that the prototypical _entrepreneur_ is some white male venture capitalist.

Technology is also a form of gatekeeping. The pipeline myth of tech recruiters has long been touted and supposedly and generously amerliorated by workshops and programs that teach coding to those underrepresented in tech. But there isn't a pipeline issue. Although those workshops and programs may be earnest, they further the narrative that tech companies are trying their best to achieve diversity without addressing why that disparity exists in the first place; a power struggle.

#### Abstraction and More Questions

The contradiction of greater clarity through greater abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science. Black-box matryoshka dolls. Is it deceitful to make a computer more human-friendly? Is the materialization of immateriality a product of a consumer culture, if not why did it arise? Where do fiat-crypto-currencies or even video games fit into this framework of thinking about computing?
