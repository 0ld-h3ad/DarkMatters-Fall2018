Reading this piece was a deep dive into topics that I had previously interacted with cursorily. There were a few sections exploring the erasure of oppressed groups that I thought were explored in a more nuanced way that I’d seen in the past. The image of a man sitting in a chair commanding a woman who was programming a mainframe computer shown in the same article as the architectural diagram of “master” “slave” helped hammer home to me the way that language choices and interpersonal dynamics perpetuate systemic societal dynamics and enforce the assumed subjugation of oppressed groups in technology. Because we rarely discuss this part of computing’s history, this oppression is erased and normalized.

I had never even thought to question the master/slave terminology as I learned about computer science in school, and that full acceptance of oppressive terminology plays right into Chun’s point that software is unquestioned ideology. I often question my news sources and the things that other people tell me, but I hadn’t thought to question “technical language” which felt immune to critique since it was rooted in “science”.

White fragility appears in the formation of the assumptions of what counts as unquestioned technical language. The “yes sir” section of the essay speaks to the foundation of programming being a white man asserting dominance by demanding things of a woman who is obligated to do the work of interpreting anything the man was saying into the computer. This places white men in positions of power from the start before there even were personal computers. These men were the ones creating the unquestioned language and setting up the power structures that now govern technology.
