9/20 homework 

Tomoya Matsuura



The gender inbalance in early age of computer programming, it reminds me a film installation work "BETWEEN THE BULLET AND THE HOLE" by Aura Satz which I saw last year. The work was using a hole as a metaphor of a hole on punch card which is used as a source code for early computer and a bullet mark. The works was impressive for me because I had studied about early computer for [my installation](http://matsuuratomoya.com/works/adm/), however, I've never know that gender problem. Most of resources, books and websites about a computer history don't mention to cultural contexts deeply.

Also my installation work was a re-creation of Acoustic-Delay-Memory in today's context. I used neither computer nor even micro-controllers but CMOS-logic gates on breadboard and ordinary speaker and microphone because I didn't want to use any blackbox-like system. However I felt some dissatisfaction after completion of the creation because I do know about how the logic gates works well but most of audiences don't know― then, for most of people, anyway the system my work is a blackbox defenitely. Also, for myself, the system was still blackbox in a sense. I can't see an inside of the logic gate, even if I could see, I can't see how the electrons moves. Even that, the system works well. The fact was strange for me.

From this experience, I began to think that we feel the magicality(mystery?) of the computer or the programming when what we felt from the result of operation is more complex, compared to a simplicity of what we made/wrote.  This is also an expansion of one's power: a fundamental element of TOOL, what makes an animal to a human. I consider this feeling is similar to Edward's "strong sensation of power and control".

I've read Manovich's "The Language of New Media" and he uses example of a synthesizer as a software because a player of synthesizer becomes "Operator" of parameters by turning many knobs. I don't prefer this example. When we turn the knobs on usual synthesizers, we know what will happen, except for some noise machines. Thus I agree to Wendy's sentence "one’s computer constantly acts in ways beyond one’s control". Is complexty of operations the problem?
