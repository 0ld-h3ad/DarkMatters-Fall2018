Response to Wendy Hui Kyong Chun “On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge”

In one sense, there is a distinction between software and hardware -- hardware is the physical object that allows for 'running', and software is the non-physical object that 'runs'.  However, in the context of  Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's essay, the delineation becomes quite blurred, especially in the sense that both hardware and software are in many ways representations of humans and manual labor, complete with job/role names reappropriated to what we now understand as computers.

I found the essay enlightening in a number of ways, and the guiding question around white male fragility was extremely helpful as a thread throughout.  With one of they keys being that the field of programming was developed by women, its history subsequently erased, as white males moved in to take over the lucrative field -- there were numerous examples throughout of fragile responses to any percieved threat on 'ivory tower' hardware development, software fundamental development, and more.  Stephenson's 'Anathem' came to mind (prior to Hui Kyong Chun's mention of Stephenson!) as a near-term science fiction description of that ivory tower -- Stephenson draws parallels to the university as priesthood, complete with 1000-year inaccessible tenures, while the text lays it out in an origins of computing perspective.

I also found many of Hui Kyong Chun's examples extremely pertinent to my own experience with corporate software development.  The notion of programming as suffering, in its many inherent frustrations with debugging, long work hours, the push to show 'street cred' before getting complex projects -- all have threads to the ideology that helped to create the field as a whole.  This is in some ways unsurprising, as it's the same broad field, and it's not particularly old -- but it certainly highlights bigger ideological barriers that need to be torn down to truly shift our relationship with software and hardware as a whole.

Last, I was fascinated by a particular portion of the text where the notion of male constructed hardware, as a mental object, is programmed or manipulated by female programmers  -- which would in turn entertain a metaphor of female programmers manipulating a male mental object or model.  I could see this idea modified/subverted by the 'machinificiation' of the earlier jobs/roles, and then modified/subverted again by our present incarnation of roles in the hardware and software development process.  Definitely an area to explore.

== Raw notes:
* Programming as suffering - parallels to programming frustration, debugging, long hours
* Stephenson, Anathem - circles of priesthood
* Programming as voltage modification
* Female sexuality as mimicry?
* Debugging in a dream
* Male constructed hardware (as mental object) -> Female programmers -> programming/manipulating male mental model
* Coding -> Result -> Pleasure -> Dopamine
* Programming as amplifier
